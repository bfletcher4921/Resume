'''Create a program to test your class. Name this separate file 
bplayer_app.py and at the top import your BaseballPlayer class. 
Inside the main function (be sure to use the homework_program.py template) 
create three objects instantiated from the class. Go to roarlions.com and 
choose three current baseball players and use their names, position and 
jersey number to make this a more realistic simulation.

Place the three player objects into a list. Code up three loops. The first 
loop must display each player's name. The second must display jerseys and 
the third displays the positions.

Make sure that if you added a fourth player to your list everything would 
work and display the attributes of all four players. In other words, 
don't hard-code anything (like the fact that your object list has 3 objects).'''
